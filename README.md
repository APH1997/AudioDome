# AUDIODOME

Welcome to AudioDome! This is a mock website created as a project to showcase our skills in web development. AudioDome aims to provide users with an immersive music streaming experience. This README file provides an overview of the project and the technologies we used to bring it to life.

## Technologies Used

AudioDome is built using a combination of frontend and backend technologies, including:

**React**
-We used React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create the interactive and dynamic frontend of AudioDome. React allowed us to efficiently manage the state of the application, handle user interactions, and create reusable components.
 
**Flask**
-Flask, a lightweight web framework written in Python, served as the backend framework for AudioDome. It enabled us to handle routing, manage API requests, and interact with the database.

**SQLAlchemy**
-SQLAlchemy, a powerful and flexible Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python, was used to interact with the database. It provided an intuitive way to define and query database models, making it easier to manage and manipulate data.

**JavaScript**
-JavaScript, the language of the web, played a crucial role in enhancing the interactivity and responsiveness of AudioDome. We utilized JavaScript to handle dynamic content updates, perform client-side validations, and make API calls to retrieve and update data.

**Python**
-We used Python, a versatile and widely-used programming language, for the backend logic of AudioDome. Python allowed us to implement business logic, handle data processing tasks, and communicate with external APIs.
